# Enigma_Machine
This is a code exercise simulating the Enigma Machine. This includes a basic case where the wiring mechanism are expressed as mathematical functions.  The code to execute the project was done in C++. This is a rough sketch, so it is not complete as of 10/01/2024. Hope you enjoy reading my code.
